    <h2> What Even Is Underwater Hockey? </h2>
    <p> Underwater hockey (UWH) is a no-contact team sport generally consisting of 6 players facing off against 6 players.
      The goal, like ice hockey, is to score the puck into a goal. The puck is pushed around by players with short sticks
      all while submerged completely underwater. Players wear masks, snorkels, and fins as well as protective gloves (on
      their stick holding hand), and headgear. Learn more from the <a href="https://usauwh.org/">official USA UWH website</a>. </p>

    <h2> How I Got Started </h2>
    <p> I first starting playing underwater hockey in January 2017. A club hosted underwater
      hockey on Monday nights at my high school pool, and I began to learn how to play the sport
      alongside my friend. Both of us had swum competitively on an USA club team and on our high
      school team so swimming was not new to us, but add in sticks, pucks, and we were completely
      out of our element. </p>
    <p> Starting out in this sport was a completely different experience, especially after competing
      in a sport where I was almost always competing "by myself." Underwater hockey is a team-sport
      and cannot be played like a solo-sport. Learning to look around for team mates to pass to, where I
      should be and when, and how to navigate among incoming players was all a new, but welcomed, experience. </p>
    <p> I was and still am very lucky to be learning to play (the learning never ends!) and playing with some
      of the most elite players in the U.S. </p>

    <h2> Why I Play </h2>
    <p> Hockey is a great full-body workout, and it has inspired me to push myself to become the best player I can be by training
      hard. Furthermore, it was one of those sports that was almost a perfect intersection between my competitive nature and a sport
      I already had experience with, swimming. (And the fact that I was never one with great foot-eye, hand-eye coordination.) </p>
    <p> However, the reason I really fell in love with the sport is the great community of people involved. All of the players from when
      I started playing were welcoming and supportive, and as I got to know them better, I felt like I had made friends with a group of amazing
      people I would not have met otherwise. </p>
