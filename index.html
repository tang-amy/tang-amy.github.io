  <h2> About Me </h2>
  <p> I am 19 year-old inspiring reseacher interested in both biology and software analysis of data generated from experiments, especially cell imaging. I have basic Java and Python experience, and I currently am learning R and Linux.</p>
  <p> Right now, I am currently a first-year studying Computer Science and Biology as a Combined B.S. major at Northeastern University in Boston, MA.</p>
  <p> In my free time, I work on side projects to learn and practice coding with different languages as well as read research papers in fields I'm interested in. I also play underwater hockey (<a href="UWH.html">check it out here!</a>), am working on improving my photography skills, and learning Mandarin.</p>
