      <h2> Personal Website (HTML and CSS) </h2>
      <p> This website was started to learn some new skills (very basic web development with HTML and CSS) as well as
        a proof-of-concept that I was able to create and maintain a website. The main goal of this website is to
        document my academic advancements through side projects and my research as well as my personal growth through
        other interests and to improve my skills regarding those interests. </p>

      <h2> HRM Genotyping (Python)</h2>
      <p> I started this project as a way to quickly be able to analyze the melting curves generated by qPCR
        for genotyping mice (read about the process of generating and analyzing HRM curves <a href="#">here<a/a>).
          This program was a simple way to transform all of the raw data, in a tab-delimited text file, to
          individual excel sheets by gene marker as well as generate folders and graphs of the analyzed data. The
          parsing and generation of files is all done in Python and the analysis portion of the code is sourced
          from an open-source code released by <a href="https://github.com/liuyigh/PyHRM">Liu Yi on Github</a>.
